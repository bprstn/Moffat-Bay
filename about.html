      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Moffat Bay Lodge began as a vision to create a peaceful haven along the
        lakeshore. With its roots in the surrounding forest and community, the lodge
        was built to offer guests a balance of natural beauty and refined comfort.
        Every stay is meant to feel like a return to simplicity, with the warmth of
        a modern lodge and the serenity of the outdoors.
